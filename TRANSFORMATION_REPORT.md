```python
# Add to cli.py chat command
from memory import MemoryManager

mem = MemoryManager()
relevant_context = mem.retrieve_relevant_context(user_input)
response = bot.chat(f"Context: {relevant_context}\n\nUser: {user_input}")
mem.add_conversation(user_input, response)
```

## 🔄 Integration Roadmap

### Week 1: Memory Integration
```python
# cli.py modifications needed
@app.command()
def chat(memory: bool = typer.Option(True)):
    mem = MemoryManager() if memory else None
    
    while True:
        user_input = Prompt.ask("You")
        
        if mem:
            context = mem.get_session_context()
            relevant = mem.retrieve_relevant_context(user_input)
            prompt = f"{context}\n\nRecent: {relevant}\n\nUser: {user_input}"
        else:
            prompt = user_input
        
        response = bot.chat(prompt)
        
        if mem:
            mem.add_conversation(user_input, response)
        
        render_code_blocks(response)
```

### Week 2: Tools Integration
```python
# cli.py modifications needed
from tools import ToolRegistry

@app.command()
def chat(agentic: bool = typer.Option(False)):
    registry = ToolRegistry() if agentic else None
    
    # In chat loop:
    if agentic and "TOOL:" in response:
        # Parse tool call from response
        tool_name, args = parse_tool_call(response)
        result = registry.call(tool_name, **args)
        # Send result back to LLM
```
