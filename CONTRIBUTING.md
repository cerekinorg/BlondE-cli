## Coding Standards

### Python Style

Follow PEP 8 with these specifics:
- Line length: 100 characters
- Use type hints where possible
- Docstrings for all public functions

```python
def fix_code(file_path: str, preview: bool = False) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Fix bugs in a Python file using AI.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the file to fix
        preview: If True, show diff without applying
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with fix results
        
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If file doesn't exist
    """
    pass
```

### File Organization

```
BlondE-cli/
â”œâ”€â”€ cli.py              # Main CLI application
â”œâ”€â”€ memory.py           # Memory management
â”œâ”€â”€ tools.py            # Agentic tools
â”œâ”€â”€ model_selector.py   # Model selection UI
â”œâ”€â”€ utils.py            # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ models/             # Model adapters
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ openrouter.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ openai.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ local.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hf.py

    â”œâ”€â”€ test_cli.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ test_memory.py
    â””â”€â”€ test_tools.py
```

### Code Quality

Use these tools:
```bash
# Format code
black cli.py

# Check types
mypy cli.py

# Lint
pylint cli.py

# Sort imports
isort cli.py
```

---

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_cli.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

### Writing Tests

Place tests in `tests/` directory:

```python
import pytest
from cli import extract_code

def test_extract_code_with_markdown():
    """Test code extraction from markdown."""
    text = "```python\nprint('hello')\n```"
    result = extract_code(text)
    assert result == "print('hello')"

def test_extract_code_without_markdown():
    """Test extraction when no markdown present."""
    text = "print('hello')"
    result = extract_code(text)
    assert result == "print('hello')"
```

### Test Coverage

Aim for:
- Unit tests for all functions
- Integration tests for commands
- Edge case coverage
- Minimum 80% code coverage

## Areas Needing Help

### High Priority
- [ ] Web UI implementation
- [ ] Plugin system
- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] Streaming API support

### Medium Priority
- [ ] More model adapters (Anthropic, Cohere, etc.)
- [ ] Custom model fine-tuning
- [ ] Export/import memory
- [ ] Multi-language support

### Low Priority / Nice to Have
- [ ] VS Code extension
- [ ] Docker support
- [ ] Cloud deployment guide
- [ ] Performance optimizations

---

## Documentation

### Where to Add Docs

- User-facing: `docs/` directory or markdown files
- Code: Inline docstrings and comments
- API: Use proper type hints and docstrings

### Documentation Style

```python
"""Module for managing AI memory using vector databases.

This module provides the MemoryManager class for storing and retrieving
conversational context using ChromaDB as the vector store backend.

Example:
    >>> memory = MemoryManager(user_id="alice")
    >>> memory.add_conversation("How do I sort a list?", "Use sorted()")
    >>> memory.retrieve_relevant_context("sorting")
    [{'text': 'How do I sort...', 'score': 0.95}]
"""
```
